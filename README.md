Global shortcuts service with GUI manager, written in Python.

---

# Installation/Use
Every supported OS (Windows, Linux, macOS) will have a `.zip` file in each release. Each archive contains two items:

1. `PyCuts`
<br>`.exe` on Windows; no extension on Linux/macOS.
<br>The listener service (backend) that actually detects keypresses and runs shortcut commands.
2. `PyCuts Config`
<br>`.exe` on Windows; no extension on Linux; `.app` on macOS.
<br>The GUI configurator that allows easily managing global shortcuts.

## Windows
1. Download and extract `PyCuts-win.zip` from the [latest release](https://github.com/DatBogie/PyCuts/releases/latest).
2. Run `install-win.bat` to create Start Menu shortcuts and install the `.exe`s to `%LOCALAPPDATA%\PyCuts`.
3. Open `PyCuts` to start the PyCuts listener service.
4. Right click on the tray icon and select `Open GUI` to open the GUI manager, or simply open `PyCuts Config`.

## Linux
1. Download and extract `PyCuts-lin.zip` from the [latest release](https://github.com/DatBogie/PyCuts/releases/latest).
2. Run `install-lin.sh` to create `~/.local/share/applications` `.desktop` files and install the binaries to `~/.local/share/PyCuts`.
3. Open `PyCuts` to start the PyCuts listener service.
4. Right click on the tray icon and select `Open GUI` to open the GUI manager, or simply open `PyCuts Config`.

## macOS
1. Download and extract `PyCuts-mac.zip` from the [latest release](https://github.com/DatBogie/PyCuts/releases/latest).
2. Run `install-mac.sh` to install `PyCuts Config.app` to `~/Applications`, and `PyCuts` to `/usr/local/bin`.
3. Open Terminal (or any other terminal emulator) and run `pycuts`. It may ask for or complain about not having certain permissions. Once it does, or you start seeing output, close the terminal window.
3. Open System Settings, go to `Privacy & Security > Accessibility`, and turn on the switch next to Terminal (or your terminal emulator app).
4. In System Settings, go to `Privacy & Security > Input Monitoring`, and turn on the switch next to Terminal (or your terminal emulator app).
